      <description>I am currently the Director of Engineering for the Air business unit at Hopper, the fastest growing travel app with over 45M installs and over $1B in bookings.
I grew up playing with legos and developing a love of building things. This pretty naturally led to a career as a software engineer. I eventually switched over management when I realized that building teams was not all that different from building software, the same excitment from solving a novel problem or tracking down a complicated bug, but with a new form of personal satisfaction from watching the people you&amp;rsquo;ve taken under your wing learn and grow.</description>
